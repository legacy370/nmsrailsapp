# README

This is a sample Rails application from Docker for Rails Developers (PragProg). 
It was generated using Docker.

We're using the app to learn about Docker, and, hopefully, how to actually
deploy a Rails app that has been Dockerized.

Although we know it uses docker machine, which is deprecated.
